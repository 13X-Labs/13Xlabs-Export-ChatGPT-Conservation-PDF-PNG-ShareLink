# 13XLabs Export PNG,PDF, ShareLink
13XLabs Export PNG,PDF, ShareLink is a tool developed by 13XLabs that allows users to export and conserve conversations generated by ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. The tool can export conversations to PDF and PNG formats, making it easy for users to share their conversations with others in a readable and accessible format. Additionally, the tool provides users with a shareable link to their conversation, which can be used to easily share the conversation with others online.

This tool is particularly useful for researchers, developers, and anyone who wants to preserve and share their conversations with ChatGPT. Users can easily export their conversations and store them for future reference or share them with others.
